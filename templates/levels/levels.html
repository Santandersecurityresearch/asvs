            <p>An application achieves ASVS Level 1 (or Opportunistic) if it adequately defends against application security
                vulnerabilities that are easy to discover, and included in the OWASP Top 10 and other similar checklists.
                <br>
                <br>Level 1 is typically appropriate for applications where low confidence in the correct use of security controls
                is required, or to provide a quick analysis of a fleet of enterprise applications, or assisting in developing
                a prioritised list of security requirements as part of a multi-phase effort. Level 1 controls can be ensured
                either automatically by tools or simply manually without access to source code. We consider Level 1 the minimum
                required for all applications.
                <br>
                <br>Threats to the application will most likely be from attackers who are using simple and low effort techniques
                to identify easy-to-find and easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities. This is in contrast to a determined attacker
                who will spend focused energy to specifically target the application. If data processed by your application
                has high value, you would rarely want to stop at a Level 1 review. </p>
            {% elif level == 2 %}
            <p>An application achieves ASVS Level 2 (or Standard) if it adequately defends against most of the risks associated
                with software today.
                <br>
                <br> Level 2 ensures that security controls are in place, effective, and used within the application. Level 2
                is typically appropriate for applications that handle significant business-to-business transactions, including
                those that process healthcare information, implement businesscritical or sensitive functions, or process
                other sensitive assets.
                <br>
                <br> Threats to Level 2 applications will typically be skilled and motivated attackers focusing on specific targets
                using tools and techniques that are highly practiced and effective at discovering and exploiting weaknesses
                within applications.</p>
            {% else %}
            <p>ASVS Level 3 is the highest level of verification within the ASVS. This level is typically reserved for applications
                that require significant levels of security verification, such as those that may be found within areas of
                military, health and safety, critical infrastructure, etc. Organisations may require ASVS Level 3 for applications
                that perform critical functions, 10 OWASP Application Security Verification Standard 3.0 where failure could
                significantly impact the organisation's operations, and even its survivability. Example guidance on the application
                of ASVS Level 3 is provided below. An application achieves ASVS Level 3 (or Advanced) if it adequately defends
                against advanced application security vulnerabilities and also demonstrates principles of good security design.
                <br>
                <br> An application at ASVS Level 3 requires more in depth analysis, architecture, coding, and testing than all
                the other levels. A secure application is modularized in a meaningful way (to facilitate e.g. resiliency,
                scalability, and most of all, layers of security), and each module (separated by network connection and/or
                physical instance) takes care of its own security responsibilities (defence in depth), that need to be properly
                documented. Responsibilities include controls for ensuring confidentiality (e.g. encryption), integrity (e.g.
                transactions, input validation), availability (e.g. handling load gracefully), authentication (including
                between systems), non-repudiation, authorization, and auditing (logging).
