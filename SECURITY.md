# Bugs Happen

Nothing is 100% secure and whilst we are taking numerous steps to ensure our code is robust and engineered properly, we welcome any security reports of vulnerabilities. 

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible
receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 9.0-10.0  | Releases within the previous three months |
| 4.0-8.9   | Most recent release                       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability


Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities via the issues functionality in this repo. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
